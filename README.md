## What is [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/)

[Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself - read more about it on the [Flask official website](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) or access the docs and start coding.
